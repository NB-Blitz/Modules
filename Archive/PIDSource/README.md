# PID Source
Example of creating a custom PIDSource

Made by Travis Gensch in 2018. When we moved from using Talon SRXs to Spark Max's during 2019, this was replaced by REV Robotics's inclusion of a [CANPIDController](https://www.revrobotics.com/content/sw/max/sw-docs/cpp/classrev_1_1_c_a_n_p_i_d_controller.html) in the [Spark Max API](https://docs.revrobotics.com/sparkmax/software-resources/spark-max-api-information).
